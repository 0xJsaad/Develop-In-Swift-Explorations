var year = "2050"
var name = "Mickey Mouse"
var adjective1 = "human"
var adjective2 = "life"
var adjective3 = "galaxy"

let game2FullSentence = " It's the year \(year)...\n Nasa astronaut \(name) is the first \(adjective1) to walk in Mars, upon arrival he finds \(adjective2) and we confirm we are not alone in this \(adjective3) "
let space = "✨🌑🚀💫🪐"
